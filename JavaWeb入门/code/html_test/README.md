HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of over 10 years of iterative development and
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

* Download the latest stable release from
  [html5boilerplate.com](https://html5boilerplate.com/). This zip file is a
  snapshot of the `dist` folder. On Windows, Mac and from the file manager on
  Linux unzipping this folder will output to a folder named something like
  `html5-boilerplate_v7.3.0`. From the command line will need to create a
  folder and unzip the contents into that folder.

  ```bash
  mkdir html5-boilerplate
  unzip html5-boilerplate*.zip -d html5-boilerplate
  ```

* Clone the git repo â€” `git clone
  https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git` - and checkout the
  [tagged release](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/releases)
  you'd like to use. The `dist` folder represents the latest version of the
  project for end users.

* Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install html5-boilerplate`
  or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add html5-boilerplate`. The resulting
  `node_modules/html5-boilerplate/dist` folder represents the latest version of
  the project for end users. Depending on what you want to use and how you want
  to use it, you may have to copy and paste the contents of that folder into
  your project directory.

* Using our new [create-html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/create-html5-boilerplate)
  project, instantly fetch the latest npm published package (or any version
  available on npm) with `npx`, `npm init` or `yarn create` without having to
  install any dependencies. Running the following `npx` command installs the
  latest version into a folder called `new-site`

  ```
  npx create-html5-boilerplate new-site
  cd new-site
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
