<p>There is clearly a need for CSS to be taken seriously by graphic artists. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and
  encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
  style sheet into this very page. The code remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external .css file.
  Yes, really.</p>
<p>
  We would like to see as much CSS1 as possible. CSS2 should be limited to widely-supported elements only. The css Zen
  Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing
  public.<br/>The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.
